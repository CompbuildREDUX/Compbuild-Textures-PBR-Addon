Compbuild Textures includes an optional downloadable PBR addon which includes PBR textures for some of the blocks in the main texture pack. 

***If you need help installing the addon, or want to suggest a feature. Join our Discord server!***

## How to install

**IMPORTANT:** Before you install the addon, install the main pack first. The main pack can be found at (https://github.com/CompbuildREDUX/Compbuild-Textures). The PBR effects also require shaders to work, be sure to use shaders as well. 

1. Install Compbuild Textures
2. Install the PBR addon
3. Once you've installed the PBR addon, put it in `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`
4. To enable the addon, place the addon over Compbuild Textures. An image is shown below.

**Installing the addon is very similar to installing the main pack, all you need to do is place the addon over the main pack.**
